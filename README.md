Nicolas Garcia-Vicente‚Äôs Data Analyst / Scientist Portfolio

Welcome to my data analyst/scientist portfolio. My name is Nicolas Garcia-Vicente, and I am currently working as a Project Manager and Independent Researcher.

I hold a B.S. in Economics with a Minor in Statistics from Colorado College, and I bring ~8 years of experience in data analysis, finance, and independent research. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, and I‚Äôve applied these tools across industries ranging from media and healthcare to sports analytics.

This portfolio highlights selected projects that demonstrate my ability to analyze large datasets, build predictive models, and generate actionable insights.

## üìä Featured ‚Äî Sports Analytics
### [Sports Betting Cheat Sheet] (https://github.com/nicogv10/Python_Projects_Showcase/blob/main/Sports_Betting_CheatSheet.pdf)

### [KOLD OU Test](./KOLD_OU_Test_github.py)
**Description**

Analyzes sequences of eight consecutive losses (e.g., MLB/NBA/NFL totals) for a given over/under pattern to evaluate whether recovery (a win) occurs within the following 2‚Äì4 games. Provides detailed breakdowns by recovery game (Game 9‚Äì12) to test the gambler‚Äôs fallacy hypothesis that long loss streaks regress to the mean.

**Technologies**

Python, pandas, Excel (openpyxl/xlsxwriter), custom streak logic, large-scale dataset handling

### [Insights Scraper](./Insights_scrape_v7.py)
**Description**

Automates web scraping of betting market data (% of bets vs % of $, line movement) for all daily games. Surfaces potential sharp plays and reverse line movement opportunities, exporting results to a formatted Excel sheet.

**Technologies**

Python, Selenium (undetected-chromedriver), BeautifulSoup, pandas, Excel formatting

### [Historical Trends](./historical_trends_vf3.py)
**Description**

Identifies active 4+ game streaks (covering ATS and totals) across MLB, NBA, and NFL datasets. Compares current streaks with historical trends (last 100 games per team) to estimate likely continuation vs reversal.

**Technologies**

Python, pandas, Excel outputs, rolling window analysis

## üè≠ Economic Geography & Research
### [Industry Co-Agglomeration](./Co-agglomeration.py)
**Description**

Iterates through all combinations of SIC industry codes to identify industries that tend to locate together geographically. Produces co-agglomeration coefficients for every pair of industries.

***Technologies***

Python, pandas, itertools

### [Location Quotients (LOCQ)](./LOCQ_final.py)
**Description**

Processes County Business Patterns (CBP) data to calculate location quotients (LOCQs) for industries by employment numbers. Merges multi-year results into a consolidated dataset.

**Technologies**

Python, pandas, glob, regex

### [Industry Establishment Maps](./estb_maps_final.py)
**Description**

Analyzes annual county-level establishment data for a specified industry and generates interactive maps to visualize geographic concentrations over time.

**Technologies**

Python, pandas, numpy, plotly.figure_factory

## üè• Healthcare & Operations Analytics
### [Distance Analysis](./Distance_Analysis_final.py)

**Description**

Addresses facility capacity constraints by calculating the closest facilities for a large patient population. Computes distances to company vs competitor facilities to support strategic planning.

**Technologies**

Python, numpy, pandas, geopy
