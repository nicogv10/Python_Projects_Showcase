Nicolas Garcia-Vicente's Data Analyst/Scientist Portfolio

Introduction
Welcome to my data analyst/scientist portfolio. My name is Nicolas Garcia-Vicente, and I am currently working as a Sr. Financial Analyst and Independent Researcher. I have a background in Economics and Statistics, with a B.S. degree from Colorado College. With over six years of experience in finance and data analysis roles, I have developed proficiency in Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. This portfolio focuses on showcasing my skills as a data analyst/scientist, with all projects implemented in Python.

Projects
Here are a few selected projects that highlight my capabilities:
1)Distance Analysis
This analysis addresses capacity constraints at multiple facilities by determining the closest facilities for a given patient population. It calculates various distance metrics, including proximity to my company's closest facility and the three closest competitor facilities for each patient. The output provides valuable insights into capacity planning for large patient populations. This project utilizes the numpy, pandas, and geopy libraries.
2)LOCQ (Location Quotients)
The LOCQ script processes County Business Patterns (CBP) data files to extract specific information related to a specified industry. It then calculates Location Quotients (LOCQs) based on employment numbers and merges the results into a single dataframe. The final merged dataframe is saved as an Excel file. This project leverages the pandas, glob, and re libraries.
3)Industry Co-agglomeration
By iterating through all possible combinations of SIC industry codes, this code performs calculations to identify industries that tend to locate together. It analyzes every set and possible combination of industries to determine co-agglomeration patterns. The pandas and itertools libraries are used in this project.
4)Industry Establishment Maps
This script analyzes a CSV file by year, examining the number of establishments at the county level for a specified industry. It generates detailed maps for each year, visualizing the concentration of establishments. The plotly.figure_factory, numpy, and pandas libraries are utilized in this project.
Feel free to explore these projects and witness my expertise in data analysis and data science.
